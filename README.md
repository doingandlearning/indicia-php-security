## Setup

-   Run `composer install` and `npm install`
-   Copy the `.env.example` to `.env`

## Notes

This repo will grow over the course of the time we have together (and possibly after).

I'll try hard not to change any files that you might be working in once shared to avoid merge conflicts.

The aim is for this repo to contain both the notes and the examples that will be used in our training.
